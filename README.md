# WeShare

WeShare is the new solution to coordinating the sharing of groceries with your housemates or apartment mates. Often times one of the primary struggles of sharing a living space with another person takes place in the kitchen. In kitchen spaces often cluttered with items, you may forget, are you the one who bought that bag of pretzels? Did your apartment mate tell you that it was ok if you used some of his/her eggs? WeShare allows for easy communication and item tracking to ease the burden of sharing a kitchen space with others.
